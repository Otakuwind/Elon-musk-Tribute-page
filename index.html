  <p>Elon Musk cofounded six companies including electric car maker Tesla, rocket producer SpaceX and tunneling startup Boring Company.</p>
<p>He owns about 25% of Tesla between stock and options, but has pledged more than half his stock as collateral for loans.</p>
SpaceX, founded in 2002, is worth $127 billion after a funding round in May 2022; it quadrupled its value in three years.
<p>Boring Company, which aims to defeat traffic, raised $675 million in April 2022 at a $5.7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion in April 2022, after he disclosed a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover.</p>
<p>In July 2022, Musk announced he was terminating the deal over bot concerns.
 Twitter sued and the parties will go to court in October.</p></center>
